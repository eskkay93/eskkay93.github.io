        <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Put the ginger and garlic into a small food processor and puree, you may need to add a bit of water to make it go. If you don't have a small food processor, you can grate by hand.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a small bowl, whisk the yogurt, vegetable oil, salt, garam masala, saffron, and 2 teaspoons of the garlic ginger mixture together. Save the remaining garlic ginger mixture for the sauce.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Put the chicken in a freezer bag and pour the marinade all over it, rubbing it into the chicken. Squeeze all the air out of the bag and seal it. Marinate for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> For the sauce, puree the stewed tomatoes with their juices along with the tomato paste in a blender or food processor.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Add the butter to a pot along with the green cardamom, black cardamom, cinnamon and cloves. Fry the mixture until the cloves are puffy.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Add the fenugreek seeds, chili peppers, and remaining garlic ginger mixture and saute until browned, and very fragrant.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> Add the pureed stewed tomatoes and tomato paste and cook this mixture over medium heat until the tomatoes have become very thick and paste-like (about 45 minutes). Once the mixture starts sputtering you'll want to stir it pretty regularly to keep the sputtering under control while maintaining enough heat to reduce the liquid.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong> While the tomatoes are reducing, grill the chicken. You can use either an outdoor grill or broiler, but in either case it needs to be very hot. You want to get the outside lightly charred, but you don't want to cook the chicken all the way through as it will finish cooking in the sauce. If you cook it completely now, it will get overcooked in the sauce.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong> Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for at least 10 minutes before cutting.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 10:</strong> In a blender or food processor, add the raw cashew nuts along with 2 cups of water. Puree until smooth and milk-like in color.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 11:</strong> When the tomato mixture is done caramelizing turn off the heat and add the cashew nut milk, whisking it together.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 12:</strong> Pass the sauce through a wire strainer into a saucepan, pressing on the solids with a silicone spatula to get as much sauce through as you can.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 13:</strong> Cut the chicken into large chunks and add it to the pot with the sauce along with the salt, fenugreek leaves and garam masala. Cook this for 6-8 minutes over medium heat until the chicken is cooked through.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 14:</strong> Add the cream and stir together and then turn the heat off. Plate the butter chicken and drizzle a little extra cream on top. Garnish with some cilantro leaves.

        <p><strong>Step 1: Mixing the dough</strong> Wash your hands as you will be kneading the dough. In a bowl, add the flour and baking powder. Measure the three cups of room temperature water. Mix in the baking powder into the flour in the dry state first. By gradually adding the water a bit at a time, knead into a dough.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 2:Dividing the dough into balls and adding the oil</strong> This mixture should give you about 10 rotis so here you will divide the dough into 10 pieces. Add a bit of flour on the rolling surface to prevent the dough from sticking. With a rolling pin, roll out each ball roughly about 6 inches in diameter. With a brush or your fingers, apply some oil to the entire surface of the dough. Apply a sprinkle of flour also. With a knife or your fingers, cut the dough from the center to end (half-way). Now take one of the cut ends and roll it towards the other cut end. You will end up with a cone like shaped dough, tuck the end into the large side. Set it down on the surface and press it down with your palm. Now this will be the balls you will roll out to cook your rotis. Let these balls sit for at least 30 minutes, up to an hour.
        <br>
        <strong>Step 3: Rolling out and cooking the roti</strong> Set up your rolling out area as close as possible to your stove. Preheat your Tawa or Frying Pan, whichever you are using. Set stove to high. On a floured surface roll out the pieces of dough about the size of your pan or tawa. Place in pan, let first side cook for about 30 seconds. Using a spatula, flip the roti, and with a brush, apply some cooking oil to the surface. After applying the oil, immediately flip again and apply oil to the other side. Let both sides cook evenly, at the end after about 45 seconds total the roti will swell. Only allow each side to have faint patches of brown. If it gets any browner it will be crispy and hard. Remove the roti from the pan. You now need to clap or shake the roti in a covered container to separate the layers. This must be done while the roti is hot!
