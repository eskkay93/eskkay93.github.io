        <h2 id="1st">1. My "Formal" Coding History</h2>
        <h5>Posted Tuesday February 18th, 2020</h5>

        <p>
          This requires a little bit of backstory. I went to college and majored in Mathematics Education. As part of the degree, I was required to take classes on the basics of computers where we learned some HTML coding. I had a personal webpage project where I posted a tutorial on how to add some text to a picture using Photoshop. Although we had learned a small amount of coding, I kept thinking about features that I could add to my page to make it even better. I remembered seeing websites where you could click on a link and it would take you to different parts of the website, so I researched how to do that and added it to my page. I thought it was the coolest thing ever to be able to click links that go to different parts of your page!
        </p>
        <p>
          The next computer course we had to take was about Java programming. I recalled using Eclipse to make patterns get printed on the screen depending on the user's input. I also remember using it to ask users for and input and giving out some kind of mathematically calculated output.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last "computer" class that I took in college was not really sold as a computer class. It was a class where we were using Mathematica to simulate a problem about the waiting room of a doctor's office and how many patients would be in there at any given time. I honestly don't remember a bit of the code or what factors we looked into when I was in the class, but I remember this being one of my favorite classes because it managed to combine Math, which I loved and was studying, with Computers, another love of mine! I remember fellow classmates asking for help from me in this class and thinking to myself that I loved it so much and I was so in-tune with what we were learning. I wished I was able to do more studying of Math and computers combined!
        </p>
        <p>
          As I'm writing this, some memories are coming back to me about a project that we worked on in my seventh grade computer class. We had to create a website about a topic in history and I remember making the background of the webpage bright red with yellow text. I remember it being hard to look at, but it matched the theme of what we were doing. I also distinctly remember having different frames on the page and having links to different pages of our compilation and our homepage needing to be called index.html.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always excelled at computer studies, but my passion for a long time was to be a Math teacher, which was the path I took in college. I've always missed the coding aspect of computers though and, in the years after I graduated, though I didn't formally do any kind of coding education, coding never left me alone.

        <h2 id="2nd">2. Coding Disguised</h2>
        <h5>Posted Tuesday February 18th, 2020</h5>
        <p>
          I really think that I was able to more in depth with coding when I got my first smart phone in my junior year of college (2013-2014). After realizing the potential in customization, I spent many hours of a whole month tweaking and modifying my homescreen and all the widgets I could place on it, making my own custom widgets when the built-in samples were not enough for me. I wish I had screenshots to include of all the modifications I made along the way. I had always been interested in fonts, collecting them and always choosing the perfect one for my homeworks and projects. When I was customizing the widgets for my homescreen, I got to choose the fonts that were being used and I got to work with the spacing of everything as well as what style of icons I wanted using icon-packs that can be downloaded from the play store. I then realized that I was able to have variables as the text on my homescreen and I jumped at the opportunity to create little widgets that would read my battery level and then display it in a graphical presentation. It was Ramadan when I got really heavy into this customization and I found out that I could hae variables representing when the sun rises and sets, and then use this information with the current time to create a bar graph that would show the progress of the fasting day. The days were pretty long then, so I opted to remove it a few days later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing research online about this homescreen customization app, called zooper widget (r.i.p), led me to find out about an android app called Tasker. Tasker was supposed to be this amazing app that could make your phone do <em>anything</em>! I needed to purchase the app for $2.99 and as someone who rarely, if ever, paid for an app, it took a lot of research to finally convince myself to give this app a go and invest my money. After more than 5 years of usage, I can tell you that it is by far the best app purchase I have ever made. I don't regret it one bit and on this day, I don't think that I could live without Tasker. It manages so many things for me and has made getting things done so much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the major reasons I was so hesitant to purchase Tasker was because of the "extremely high learning curve" that everyone talked about online. There is no place online that will tell you that Tasker is easy to use. I would say that Tasker is easy to use if you want to only do simple things with it. For instance, some of the first things that I did with Tasker was to use it to make sure that if my phone was ringing, that the ringer volume was at the highest volume. However, this only needed to happen if my phone was already on sound mode. This was very simple to program in tasker. This required two of the four major parts of Tasker, the Profiles and the Tasks. The task is exactly what it seems to be, a set of instructions on what to do and what order to do it in. In this case, the task is to set the ringer volume to the highest volume. The second part, the Profile, is where you set the "thing" that will trigger the task. In this case, the "thing" that would make the ringer volume increase is receiving an incoming call.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eventually moved on to writing my battery levels to a text file so that I could more properly analyze my phone battery usage. The funniest thing that I could do at the time was make my phone talk, and I set up a profile that would speak when my phone was finished charging. It actually ended up scaring me a few times. Some of the slightly more complicated things that I worked on in Tasker was the reminder system for when my brother needs to get dropped to and picked up from the subway. I eventually learned how to use Tasker to create a standalone app that could be exported as an .apk that could be installed on my brother's phone. Don't get too excited, I didn't actually see the intricacies that went into compiling the app, just the GUI on the Tasker end. This little app sends a text to myself, my mother, and my father letting us know various stops that my brother is at. Tasker then interprets this message and speaks aloud that my brother is on the train or that we need to go and get him now. As time went on, I added more to this program as needs came around. I also added a feature that will give me a notification every morning with what my brother's schedule is, and a Scene (the third major part of tasker) that you can access by clicking on an icon on your homescreen and see what the schedule is in case you swiped it away. I think one of the most beneficial ones that uses tasker more to its full potential is what I programmed it to do in case we get the first text from my brother and we never get the second text probably because of a lack of service at the stop or if he simply forgets to send us the second text. I had Tasker record the time that the first text is received in a Variable (the last major part of Tasker) that can be accessed by other parts of Tasker. I then add 40 minutes to that time, taking into account that the number may become more than 60, so it needs to wrap, and it will keep this time in its memory until it gets the second text. If the second text is received, the time is cleared and everything is reset. If my brother does not text back within the time, then Tasker will make an announcement at that time that will remind us that we have to go pick him up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently made a little menu for my home screen that I like to be able to do automatically. I won't go into detail here, but I'll cover the gist of it. One of the things I like to be able to do is to create a custom notification using Tasker as a form of a reminder for myself. I found that the Google Assistant reminders were not as reliable as they used to be, so I created this little screen where I could enter whatever I wanted in a text box and I could just hit a button that would take that text and place it in a notification! The last thing that I did in Tasker was to create a custom reminder system to again rival the Google Assistant's unreliable location reminders. I am only able to set reminders for a location that I have already designated. The places that were most important for me to remember to do stuff is when I get home, to Costco, to BJ's, and my Grandmother's house. I can now set my own custom reminders for those places, multiple reminders even, and get reliable reminders as soon as I arrive at a location!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first Tasker profile I mentioned, there were no variables used, by the end, in my custom location reminders project, I was using arrays! I know that arrays are used in coding, but I don't know the specifics. I also knew that arrays existed in Tasker, but hadn't done any research into how they worked. I'm nowhere near being a master at coding, but I believe that using Tasker has turned me into someone who will be a great coder. I learned that it's just a small idea that can spark something big. I learned that research is the answer to most problems and that 9 times out of 10, someone else had the same problem as you and has already posted about it online. I learned that sometimes you need to step away from a problem to get a new perspective on it. I learned that explaining what you're working on and showing it to someone can lead to you discovering a problem in your program and inspire you to figure out how to fix it. I learned that somtimes jumping straight into something is a great way to get really familiar with it. I learned that it never hurts to click around and see what happens when you click this or that. I really feel like my years of "messing around" with Tasker will only help jump-start my career in coding.

        <h2 id="3rd">3. Back to Computer-Based Coding</h2>
        <h5>Posted Wednesday Februrary 19, 2020</h5>
        <p>
          Now that you've read about my coding background, I can tell you about why I'm getting back into it. I was working as a math teacher in a high school and as much as it was fulfilling, I knew that it was not a job that I would find sustainable in the long term. I eventually did leave teaching and was not working for two years. I have decided that I'm ready to go back to work doing something that I love and enjoy. I did love and enjoy Math, but it's never the thing you could catch me doing in my spare time. I sometimes spend hours a day working on Tasker projects, researching and testing. I'm applying to a program where I would get to study HTML, CSS, and JS. I wanted to be super-prepared, so I'm working on this KhanAcademy course. I really enjoy that I don't have a professor to control the pace that I want to work on things and that I'm free to look up material from elsewhere that I can implement here as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other major thing that I learned to prep for this course was learning how to type on a physical keyboard. I'm 26 and I've finally learned how to type. My entire family had been encouraging me to learn to type since I was young and they even got software and games that would teach me how to type and I was just never interested. Upon learning that I had to do a typing test to get into this program, I started learning how to type as soon as I got home. I found out that the website that was going to be used for testing was typingtest.com and I did an initial test to see how fast I could type using the method I had been using all throughout grade school, high school, college, and my first three years of work. I got a speed of 62! But I was looking at the keyboard. Which is a terrible thing for a coder! I started working on the typing practice lessons on the website and I was starting out with a speed of 25 wpm, which is terrible, but at least I wasn't looking at the keyboard. I eventually worked for a whole week and got my speed up to the early 40s at home. When I took the test, I ended up getting a 38, which is just about what they were looking for but not anything impressive. I really hope that I get into the program. It would be a Godsend!</p>

        <h2 id="4th">4. CSS Grouping Classes and Elements, and Descendants</h2>
        <h5>Posted Saturday February 22, 2020</h5>
        <p>
          So, I learned some cool things today and I wanted to take a few minutes to record them here so that I can refer back to them whenever I need to.
        </p>
        <img class="element" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/HTML_element_structure.svg/1200px-HTML_element_structure.svg.png">
        <p>
          I also wanted to record the following image here, becaue I keep forgetting the names of the different parts of the html element.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this instance, the p, indicating that we are starting a paragraph, is the element name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interesting things I learned about are applying multiple css rules to an element or to different groups of elements. Since at the moment, I can't seem to figure out how to show example code on a website, I created another KhanAcademy webpage dedicated to the usage of multiple element styles and using css descendants. You can view it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/grouping-css-classes-and-elements-and-descendants/6413404323725312">here</a>.
